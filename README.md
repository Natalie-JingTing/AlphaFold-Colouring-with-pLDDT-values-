# AlphaFold-Colouring with pLDDT values-
Codes in this repo has been written by Eugene Gan, Ng Jing Ting and Tay Hui Yi for SP3172 - Decoding Capsule Synthesis, under Prof. Sham Lok To.

The notebook allows users to colour their structures generated from AlphaFold with the pLDDT values generated. 
A new PDB file with the b-factor column edited with pLDDT values will be created. Opening the file with softwares such as PyMol will allow the user to view the coloured structure.


It is possible to loop the code to edit all b-factor values.


Instructions are within the notebook, commented out.
